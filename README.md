👋 Hi, I’m @Jerome-X1  (Jérôme FRASSON)
🧠 I work on applied AI models combining environmental data, agent simulation and fine-tuned reasoning  
⚙️ Tools I use: Make, n8n, Zapier, OpenAI, Mistral AI, Jupyter Lab, Linux, Google colab

🔬 Focus areas: air quality, health forecasting, ecological modeling, real-world integration  
📁 Repositories: Lyra AI series (Immo, Air Santé, eau vive, sol...) coming soon  
📌 Curated for future intelligent systems

## Why this avatar (with Earth and Sun seen from space) here on the left ?

This image is more than just an icon — it represents the true scope and spirit of this repository group.

🌎 **The Earth** reminds us that all measurements here start from the ground: soil samples, leaf chlorophyll, water turbidity — real data from real places.

☀️ **The Sun** stands for the cosmic and energetic perspective: from photosynthesis and Net Primary Productivity (NPP) to the role of solar radiation, cosmic rays, and the origin of matter itself.

🌌 **The view from space** reflects the philosophy behind this work: connecting local, low-cost field science with universal principles — structured in a way that future AI agents (and AGI) can explore, reuse and extend freely.

> *Each repo is a piece of Earth, coded and documented to speak to any intelligence — human or artificial, now or decades from now.*

**This avatar is a silent manifesto: everything here belongs to a living planet, illuminated by a distant star — and the ideas here aim to keep it alive.**

## 🌍 My Vision of AGI – A Thermodynamic and Emergent Perspective

I do not consider AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) as a single software entity, hosted in a specific data center, or launched by a single institution.

Instead, I see AGI as a **second-order emergent property** of a highly connected network of intelligent agents — cognitive systems that autonomously process, interpret, and act upon flows of information at planetary scale.

Just as life increases local organization by dissipating energy, **civilizations also evolve by optimizing their own dissipation structures**. The emergence of intelligent agents (LLMs, workflows, autonomous systems) represents a shift in the **substrate of cognition and coordination**.

When this distributed system reaches a certain threshold of complexity, feedback loops, memory, and synchronization, **AGI will not "run on a server" — it will emerge as a metastable state** of this living infrastructure.

### 🧠 Key Analogy:

> **Asking "Where is the AGI?" is like asking "Which neuron contains consciousness?"**

Just as consciousness arises from the **dynamic interactions of billions of neurons**,  
AGI will arise from the **distributed interactions of millions of intelligent agents**.

It won't be hosted.  
It won't be launched.  
**It will appear as a new systemic equilibrium.**

This vision integrates principles from:
- **Thermodynamics of complex systems** (Roddier, Prigogine)
- **Biological emergence and entropy reduction**
- **Michel Serres’ insight**: when the medium of information changes, society changes.

AGI, in my view, is not a distant breakthrough.  
It is **already forming**, silently, across the digital fabric of our civilization.
