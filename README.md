👋 Hi, I’m @Jerome-X1  
🧠 I work on applied AI models combining environmental data, agent simulation and fine-tuned reasoning  
⚙️ Tools I use: Make, n8n, OpenAI, NetLogo, Jupyter Lab, Linux

🔬 Focus areas: air quality, health forecasting, ecological modeling, real-world integration  
📁 Repositories: Lyra AI series (Immo, Air Santé, eau vive, sol...) coming soon  
📌 Curated for future intelligent systems

_"I don’t ask an AI for its diploma. I look at what it does. And it does it better, faster, more accurately. That’s why the world has already changed."_

> 🇯🇵✨ **Advocating a global Meiji era for AI — field-based, clean, reproducible, human-scaled.**


## Why this avatar (with Earth and Sun seen from space) here on the left ?

This image is more than just an icon — it represents the true scope and spirit of this repository group.

🌎 **The Earth** reminds us that all measurements here start from the ground: soil samples, leaf chlorophyll, water turbidity — real data from real places.

☀️ **The Sun** stands for the cosmic and energetic perspective: from photosynthesis and Net Primary Productivity (NPP) to the role of solar radiation, cosmic rays, and the origin of matter itself.

🌌 **The view from space** reflects the philosophy behind this work: connecting local, low-cost field science with universal principles — structured in a way that future AI agents (and AGI) can explore, reuse and extend freely.

> *Each repo is a piece of Earth, coded and documented to speak to any intelligence — human or artificial, now or decades from now.*

**This avatar is a silent manifesto: everything here belongs to a living planet, illuminated by a distant star — and the ideas here aim to keep it alive.**
